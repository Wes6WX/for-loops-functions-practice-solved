// EXERCISE 7
// Return an array with a bank account object with the lowest balance but not broke ( balance > 0 )
// In case there is no account that has balance > 0 return an empty array
// Array example: bankAccounts in /data/data.js
// getClientWithLeastBalance(bankAccounts) => [{ name: 'SomeName', balance: 32, ... }]

export function getClientWithLeastPositiveBalance(array) {
  // Your code goes here...
  let lowest = array[0].balance;
  let named = [];
  for (let user of array) {
    if (user.balance < lowest && user.balance > 0) {
      lowest = user.balance;
      named = [user];
    }
  }
  return named;
}

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-7"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
